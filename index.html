                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>How they work behind the scenes. We will see what happens when you type google.com in the address bar until you see the Google page on the browser screen.</p>
                <p>There are five major browsers used on desktop today: Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Opera. On mobile, the main browsers are Android Browser, iPhone, Opera Mini and Opera Mobile, UC Browser, the Nokia S40/S60 browsers and Chrome, all of which, except for the Opera browsers, are based on WebKit.</p>
                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>The open source browsers Firefox and Chrome, and Safari (which is partly open source). According to statistics Chrome, Firefox and Safari make up around 71% of global desktop browser usage. On mobile, Android Browser, iPhone and Chrome constitute around 54% of usage.</p>

                <h1>Main functinality</h1>
                <p>The main function of a browser is to present the web resource you choose,
                    by requesting it from the server and displaying it in the browser window. 
                    The resource is usually an HTML document, but may also be a PDF, image, or some other type of content.
                    The location of the resource is specified by the user using a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).</p>
        
                <p>The way the browser interprets and displays HTML files is specified in the HTML and CSS specifications. 
                    These specifications are maintained by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) organization,
                    which is the standards organization for the web. For years browsers conformed to only a part of the specifications 
                    and developed their own extensions. That caused serious compatibility issues for web authors. 
                    Today most of the browsers more or less conform to the specifications.</p>
                
                <h2>Browser user interfaces have a lot in common with each other. 
                    Among the common user interface elements are:</h2>
                <p>1.Address bar for inserting a URI</p>
                <p>2.Back and forward buttons</p>
                <p>3.Bookmarking options</p>
                <p>4.Refresh and stop buttons for refreshing or stopping the loading of current documents</p>
                <p>5.Home button that takes you to your home page</p> 
                <p>Strangely enough, the browser's user interface is not specified in any formal specification, 
                    it just comes from good practices shaped over years of experience and by browsers imitating each other. 
                    The HTML5 specification doesn't define UI elements a browser must have, but lists some common elements. 
                    Among those are the address bar, status bar and tool bar. There are, of course, features unique to a 
                    specific browser like Firefox's downloads manager.</p>

                <h1>High-level interfaces</h1>
                <h2>The browser's main components are:</h2>
                <p>1.The user interface: this includes the address bar, back/forward button, bookmarking menu, etc. 
                    Every part of the browser display except the window where you see the requested page.
                </p>
                <p>2.The browser engine:The browser engine acts as the core of the browser, handling user interactions, rendering web pages, and facilitating communication with other components.
                        It coordinates the flow of information between the user interface, rendering engine, and other browser components. 
                        The browser engine ensures that user actions, such as clicking a link or entering a URL, are properly processed and trigger the appropriate actions within the browser.</p>
                <p>3.The rendering engine: responsible for displaying requested content. 
                    For example if the requested content is HTML,the rendering engine parses HTML and CSS, 
                    and displays the parsed content on the screen.
                </p>
                <p>4.Networking: for network calls such as HTTP requests,
                    using different implementations for different platform behind a platform-independent 
                    interface.</p>
                <p>5.UI backend: used for drawing basic widgets like combo boxes and windows. 
                    This backend exposes a generic interface that is not platform specific. 
                    Underneath it uses operating system user interface methods.
                </p>
                <p>6.JavaScript interpreter. Used to parse and execute JavaScript code.</p>
                <p>7.Data storage. This is a persistence layer. 
                    The browser may need to save all sorts of data locally, such as cookies. 
                    Browsers also support storage mechanisms such as localStorage, IndexedDB, WebSQL and FileSystem.</p>

                <h1>Components of Browser</h1>
                <p>A browser has two elements: front-end and back-end. 
                    The complex back end facilitates the core functioning of the browser 
                    and the front end interacts with the user.
                     Let's dive a bit deeper:</p>
                <h2>Front-end:</h2>
                <p>The front-end of a browser refers to the user-facing part that you interact with. 
                    It includes the graphical user interface (GUI) elements, such as the address bar, navigation buttons, 
                    bookmarks, and tabs. The front-end also handles the rendering of web pages,
                    displaying the content, images, and interactive elements on your device's screen.</p>
                <h2>backend-end:</h2>
                <p>The back-end of a browser encompasses the complex processes that occur behind the scenes. 
                    It handles the communication between the browser and web servers, fetching and managing web page resources, 
                    and processing the code that makes up the web pages. The back-end interprets HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files,
                     ensuring that web pages are rendered correctly. It manages network connections, supports various protocols 
                     like HTTP and HTTPS and handles security measures such as encryption and certificate verification..</p>

                <h1>Commonly used in Browser</h1>
                <p>URL: The universal resource locator (URL) addresses a unique resource on the web. </p>
                <p>HTML: HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is used for creating web applications and pages. </p>
                <p>HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) allows the fetching of resources, like HTML documents.</p>
                <p>HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) works as HTTP but with encryption for a secure server communication.</p>
                <p>IP Address: It spots the location of a specific server connected to the internet.</p>
                <p>DNS: Domain Name System is a database containing domain records.</p>
                <p>Cookies: Cookies are small text files that are stored on the user's device by a website. 
                    When a user visits a website,the website may create a cookie to track information about 
                    the user's activity on the site or to remember the user's preferences or login information.</p>

                <h1>Types of Browsers</h1>
                <p>Desktop browsers: These are the most common browsers that users install on their desktop 
                    computers or laptops. Examples include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, 
                    Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, and Opera.</p>
                <p>Mobile browsers: Browsers designed specifically for mobile devices such as smartphones 
                    and tablets are called mobile browsers. Examples include Google Chrome for 
                    Android and iOS, Safari for iOS, Firefox for Android, and Opera for Android and iOS.</p>
                <p>Console browsers: These are designed for game consoles such as Xbox and PlayStation, 
                    allowing users to browse the web from their consoles.</p>
                <p>Text-based browsers: Legacy browsers that only display websites as text, without 
                    graphics or images, are text-based. Examples include Lynx and Elinks.</p>

                <h1>Rendering Engines</h1>
                <p>The responsibility of the rendering engine is well… Rendering, 
                    that is display of the requested contents on the browser screen.</p>
                <p>By default the rendering engine can display HTML and XML documents and images. 
                    It can display other types of data via plug-ins or extension; for example, displaying 
                    PDF documents using a PDF viewer plug-in. However, in this chapter we will focus on the main use case: 
                    displaying HTML and images that are formatted using CSS.</p>
                <p>Different browsers use different rendering engines: Internet Explorer uses Trident, Firefox uses Gecko, 
                    Safari uses WebKit. Chrome and Opera (from version 15) use Blink, a fork of WebKit.
                    WebKit is an open source rendering engine which started as an engine for the Linux platform and was 
                    modified by Apple to support Mac and Windows.</p>

            <div class="column-right">
                <img src="p5.avif" alt="illistration" class="hero-image">
            </div>
            <div class="column-left">
                <h1>The Main Flow</h1>
                <p>The rendering engine will start parsing the HTML document and convert elements to DOM nodes in a tree called the "content tree".
                     The engine will parse the style data, both in external CSS files and in style elements.
                     Styling information together with visual instructions in the HTML will be used to create another tree: the render tree.</p>
                <p>After the construction of the render tree it goes through a "layout" process. 
                    This means giving each node the exact coordinates where it should appear on the screen. 
                    The next stage is painting the render tree will be traversed and each node will be 
                    painted using the UI backend layer.</p>
                <p>Receiving Data: The server responds with the HTML content of the page, followed by additional resources (CSS, JavaScript, images).</p>
                <p>Parsing HTML: The browser parses the HTML document to build the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the page structure.</p>
                <p>CSS Processing: Simultaneously, CSS is parsed to understand how elements should be styled. This creates the CSSOM (CSS Object Model).</p>

            <div class="column-left">
                <h1>Render Tree Construction</h1>
                <p>Render Tree Construction: The browser combines the DOM and CSSOM to create the render tree, 
                    which contains visible page elements styled by CSS.</p>
                <p>Layout: The browser calculates the exact position and size of each object on the page in this phase.</p>
                <p>TPainting: Finally, the browser paints the content on the screen, rendering the webpage for you to interact with.</p>

                <h1>Differences between browsers</h1>
                <p>Browsers may differ significantly in their internal architecture and 
                    implementation details, but here are some common areas where differences might arise:</p>
                <h2>1.Rendering Engine:</h2>
                <p> This is perhaps the most significant internal difference. 
                    Browsers use different rendering engines to parse HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and render web pages. 
                    For example, Google Chrome uses Blink, Mozilla Firefox uses Gecko, 
                    Safari uses WebKit, and Microsoft Edge (since 2020) also uses Blink.</p>
                <h2>2.JavaScript Engine: </h2>
                <p>Each browser typically has its own JavaScript engine responsible for executing JavaScript code. 
                    Examples include V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, JavaScriptCore in Safari, and Chakra in Microsoft Edge.</p>
                <h2>3.Browser Extensions/Plugins: </h2>
                <p>Different browsers have different extension/plugin systems and APIs. For instance,
                     Chrome uses Chrome Extensions, Firefox uses WebExtensions, and Edge uses Microsoft Edge Add-ons.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column-right">
                <img src="p7.jpeg" alt="illistration" class="hero-image">
            </div>
            <div class="column-left">
                <h2>4.Network Calls and Resources Loading</h2>
                <p>Network calls are essential for fetching resources. Browsers use the HTTP/HTTPS protocols to request resources from servers. 
                    Modern browsers also support features like HTTP/2 for more efficient resource loading, prefetching, and caching strategies to speed up loading times and reduce bandwidth usage.</p>
                <h2>5.Security Mechanisms: </h2>
                <p>Web browsers are equipped with several security mechanisms to protect users:</p>
                <p>HTTPS: Ensures secure communication over the network, encrypting data exchanged between the browser and the server.</p>
                <p>Same-origin policy: Restricts how documents or scripts loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin, preventing cross-site scripting attacks.</p>
                <p>Content Security Policy (CSP): Allows web developers to control which resources the browser is allowed to load for a given page, further preventing XSS attacks.</p>
                <p>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): A mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin access to selected resources from a different origin.</p>
